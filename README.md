## Heart Attack Prediction Project

This project will use the data from this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset.

1. First, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

2. Next, we perform hypothesis testing to try to establish evidence that certain features are strong predictors of a patient's heart attack risk.

3. Finally, we use logistic regression to build a model to predict the likelihood of a patient's having a heart attack.
