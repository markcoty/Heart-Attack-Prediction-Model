## Heart Attack Prediction Project

The goal of this project is to use the data from this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset
and first to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on it.

Next, we will perform hypothesis testing to try to establish evidence that certain features are strong predictors of a patient's heart attack risk.

Finally, we will use logistic regression to build a model to predict the likelihood of a patient's having a heart attack.
